# Iterative Closest Point Algorithm for 3D Surface Matching

## Project Overview
This project delves into enhancing the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Algorithm for improved 3D surface alignment. Building on foundational ICP matching techniques, our work introduces iterative refinements to accurately align 3D surfaces, focusing on surgical applications.

## Objectives
- Implement the full ICP Algorithm, extending prior work with iterative enhancements.
- Optimize nearest neighbor search methods for efficiency and accuracy.
- Validate and visualize the algorithm's performance through comprehensive error analysis.

## Implementation Highlights
- Developed two nearest neighbor search methods: Brute Force and Covariance Tree.
- Utilized `transform.py`, a self crafted transformation class for point transformations and rigid registrations.
- Conducted extensive validation, showcasing the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency.
